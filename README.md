# Arduino based brachiograph clock
This project was inspired by https://www.brachiograph.art/ .
This code, instead of using raspberry pi, runs on arduino. It uses the cosine law of triangles
to convert from x-y positions to the angles for the 2 joins.
The project was built as project 2 of Mark Rober's engineering class.
